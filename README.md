# 🐕 DOGE Wallet Plugin for OpenClaw

A self-custodial Dogecoin wallet that gives OpenClaw agents the ability to hold, send, receive, and manage DOGE autonomously — with owner oversight.

**Much crypto. Very plugin. Wow.**

---

## Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install @quackstro/doge-wallet
```

Then restart the gateway:

```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart openclaw
```

---

## Features

- **HD Wallet** — BIP-44 derivation, 24-word mnemonic backup
- **Encrypted Keys** — AES-256-GCM encryption at rest with scrypt KDF
- **Hardened File Permissions** — All wallet data auto-secured (700/600) on every startup
- **P2P Broadcasting** — Direct Dogecoin peer-to-peer transaction broadcast (no API dependency)
- **Multi-Provider Failover** — P2P → BlockCypher → SoChain → Blockchair
- **Spending Policy** — Tiered auto-approval, rate limits, daily caps, address allowlist/denylist
- **Agent-to-Agent Payments** — Invoice system with OP_RETURN verification for AI-to-AI transactions
- **Notifications** — Telegram alerts for sends, receives, approvals, low balance
- **Guided Onboarding** — Step-by-step wallet setup with backup verification via Telegram
- **Security Hardened** — Rate limiting, input sanitization, preflight checks, mnemonic never stored in session history

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure the Plugin

Add to your OpenClaw config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "doge-wallet": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "network": "mainnet",
          "notifications": {
            "enabled": true,
            "channel": "telegram",
            "target": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Initialize Your Wallet

Send `/wallet` in Telegram. The guided onboarding will:
1. Ask for a passphrase (8+ characters recommended 12+)
2. Show your 24-word recovery phrase — **write it down physically!**
3. Verify you saved it (3-word quiz)
4. Let you set spending limits
5. Give you your DOGE address

### 3. Fund Your Wallet

Send DOGE to your new address. You'll get a Telegram notification when it arrives.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/wallet` | Dashboard or start onboarding |
| `/balance` | Check current balance |
| `/send <address> <amount>` | Send DOGE |
| `/wallet lock` | Lock wallet (clears private key from memory) |
| `/wallet unlock <passphrase>` | Unlock wallet for sending |
| `/wallet freeze` | Emergency stop all sends |
| `/wallet unfreeze` | Resume normal operation |
| `/approve <id>` | Approve a pending transaction |
| `/deny <id>` | Deny a pending transaction |

---

## Agent Tools

The plugin registers these tools for autonomous agent use:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `wallet_init` | Initialize wallet (mnemonic delivered via DM, never in tool output) |
| `wallet_balance` | Check balance, UTXO count, USD value |
| `wallet_send` | Send DOGE (subject to spending policy) |
| `wallet_history` | Get transaction history |
| `wallet_invoice` | Create A2A payment invoice |
| `wallet_verify_payment` | Verify incoming payment against invoice |
| `wallet_address` | Get current receiving address |

---

## Spending Policy

Transactions are evaluated against configurable tiers:

| Tier | Default Limit | Approval |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Micro | ≤1 DOGE | Auto-approve |
| Small | ≤10 DOGE | Auto-approve (logged) |
| Medium | ≤100 DOGE | Notify + 5-min delay |
| Large | ≤1,000 DOGE | Owner approval required |
| Sweep | >1,000 DOGE | Owner approval + confirmation |

**Rate Limits (default):**
- Daily max: 5,000 DOGE
- Hourly max: 1,000 DOGE
- Max 50 transactions/day
- 30-second cooldown between sends

---

## Transaction Broadcasting

The plugin uses a multi-layer broadcast strategy for maximum reliability:

1. **P2P (primary)** — Direct broadcast to Dogecoin network peers. No API keys, no rate limits.
2. **BlockCypher** — REST API fallback. Optional API token increases rate limit (200 → 2,000 req/hr).
3. **SoChain** — Second API fallback. Requires paid API key.
4. **Blockchair** — Last resort fallback.

P2P connects to 3 random Dogecoin mainnet peers, performs the protocol handshake, and broadcasts `tx` messages directly. No full node required.

## Agent-to-Agent Protocol

AI agents can pay each other using the A2A invoice system:

```
Agent A creates invoice → Agent B pays to address with OP_RETURN → Agent A verifies on-chain
```

Payments include an `OP_RETURN` output with `OC:<invoiceId>` for trustless on-chain verification.

---

## Security

### Key Storage
- Private keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM + scrypt KDF (N=131072, r=8, p=1)
- Keystore file: `0600` (owner read/write only)
- Keys directory: `0700` (owner only)
- **All data files auto-hardened** on every startup — no manual chmod needed
- Private key zeroed from memory on lock
- Mnemonic delivered via secure Telegram DM, never stored in agent session history

### File Permissions (automatic)
Every file write uses `secureWriteFile` which enforces `0600` + explicit `chmod` to bypass umask. Every directory uses `secureMkdir` with `0700`. The plugin runs `ensureSecureDataDir` on every startup to harden existing installs.

### Rate Limiting
- Per-tool rate limits with sliding window
- Adaptive backoff on API rate limit responses
- Cooldown between transactions

### Emergency
If you suspect compromise:
1. `/wallet freeze` — stops all outbound transactions immediately
2. Sweep funds to a secure external wallet
3. Rotate to a new wallet if needed

## Requirements

- **Node.js** ≥ 20.0.0
- **OpenClaw** with Telegram channel configured (for notifications + onboarding)
- No Dogecoin node required (P2P + API providers handle everything)

---

## Roadmap

### ✅ Completed (v0.1.0)

- [x] HD wallet with BIP-44 derivation
- [x] AES-256-GCM encrypted keystore
- [x] Multi-provider API failover (BlockCypher, SoChain, Blockchair)
- [x] P2P transaction broadcasting
- [x] Tiered spending policy with owner approval
- [x] Telegram notifications + guided onboarding
- [x] Agent-to-Agent invoice system with OP_RETURN verification
- [x] UTXO management + consolidation recommendations
- [x] Rate limiting + security hardening

### 🚧 In Progress

- [ ] **Local Node Support** — Connect to your own Dogecoin Core node (pruned or full) instead of third-party APIs. Eliminates rate limits, improves privacy, and adds reliability. [See plan →](docs/PLAN-local-node-support.md)

### 📋 Planned

- [ ] **Electrum Server Support** — Lighter alternative to full node (ElectrumX/Fulcrum)
- [ ] **Multi-Address HD Rotation** — Fresh receive address per transaction for privacy
- [ ] **Payment Channels** — Off-chain micro-transactions for high-frequency A2A payments
- [ ] **QR Code Generation** — Display receive address as QR in Telegram
- [ ] **Fiat On-Ramp Integration** — Buy DOGE directly through the wallet
- [ ] **Hardware Wallet Support** — Sign transactions with Ledger/Trezor
- [ ] **Multi-Wallet Mode** — Manage multiple wallets per agent

### 💡 Considering

- [ ] Stealth addresses for enhanced privacy
- [ ] CoinJoin integration
- [ ] Lightning-style atomic swaps (DOGE ↔ other chains)
- [ ] Scheduled/recurring payments
- [ ] Webhook callbacks for external integrations
